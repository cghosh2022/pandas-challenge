# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge

Created a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Then cloned the new repository to the terminal.

Created a folder PyCitySchools. Used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook for this assignment. After analysis created a detailed report including a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

District Summary -
Performed  the necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame which included the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary - 
Performed the necessary calculations and then created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school including the following:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and displayed the top 5 rows. Then saved the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and displayed the top 5 rows. Saved the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

Math Scores by Grade
Created a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).The following metrics in the table were included:
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Scores by School Size
Created new DataFrame showing school performance based on the "School Type".

Scores by School Type
Used the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.This new DataFrame showed school performance based on the "School Type".
